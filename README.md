**[Node.js](http://nodejs.org) v4.x.x - v6.9.x .**

Gulp should open browser, if not visit http://localhost:3000/ to see live project

### Description

I followed the instructions and I used scss without the addition of any framework. 
I tried to demonstrate usage of the partials, mixins, variables in the project.
I did not want to burden the project by importing two different icon fonts (material icons, font awsome). I used only material icons, so it is noticable that when it comes to icons, the design is not fully respected (delete, edit icons). In real project, I would probably use custom icons or discussed with designers about it.
Even though Javascript was used minimal, only to simulate dynamic behavior. 
Because of the cleaner folder structure, I decided to put a JS in separate folder.
I used vanilla JS not JQuery.
